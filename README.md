## Getting Started

To access the app, you may locate it via the app icon on the menubar on MacOS, or via the taskbar on Windows. 

Clicking on the icon opens up the main interface showing all of your recordings and imported media, as well as the associated transcriptions.

To start a new recording, you may activate the default shortcut by holding down ```Shift + C``` and activate it again to stop the recording.

To import your own media for transcribing, you may click on the upload button and upload a video/audio file. 

It is recommended to keep all recordings and imports under 3 minutes long, as the transcribing process may take a while.

To rename a recording, click on the name of the recording and enter a new name.

The buttons next to each recording are Listen to recording, Edit transcription, and Delete recording respectively.

To change the default shortcut, click on the settings button, and click on the edit button next to the current shortcut. While the input is focused, hold down your desired keyboard shortcut, and click on the save button once done. Note that this shortcut is a global shortcut, and as long as the app is running, activating the shortcut will start a new recording even if the app is minimised.
